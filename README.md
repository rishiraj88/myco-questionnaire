- Beautiful radio buttons
- Next/Previous buttons to navigate among questions. Answers will be retained as answered/unanswered while navigating.
- Question box size animation "Ember Animated"

### Note
Minor known imperfections are left there in the app/site which may be improvised as per client requirements.
